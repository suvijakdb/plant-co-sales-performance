## Project Background
Plant Co., a global e-commerce leader in popular plant products, possesses extensive sales data reflecting its marketing performance and product appeal. 

This project will analyze this valuable data to uncover actionable insights, directly driving Plant Co.'s commercial growth and strategic decision-making.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- Sales Trends Analysis: Evaluation of historical sales patterns, globally and by region, with a focus on Gross Profit, Order Volume, and Year-over-Year (YoY) Sales growth.

- Product Performance Analysis: In-depth examination of individual plant product lines to understand their contribution to overall sales, profitability, and return rates.

- Regional Sales & Order Comparison: A comparative assessment of sales performance and order volumes across different geographical regions.

- Current vs. Previous Year Sales (Same Period): Direct comparison of sales data from the current year against the same period in the previous year to identify short-term trends and performance shifts.

- High-Value Customer Segmentation: Identification and analysis of customer accounts demonstrating sales and profit figures above the annual average.

## Executive Summary
Overview of Findings
Key performance indicators presented a mixed picture year-over-year (YOY): while total sales value decreased by 512.26K (YTD vs PYTD), order volume notably increased by 17.05K units over the same period. This divergence strongly suggests a significant decrease in average sales value. Despite these top-line challenges, the Gross Profit Margin (GP%) remained resilient at 39.62%, showing no significant decline from 2022. This stability in GP% offers a positive signal amidst the sales downturn. The following section will delve into the contributing factors behind these trends and highlight key areas for improvement.

## Sales Trends:
- Significant sales downturns occurred in February 2023, with revenue at $343.79K from 42,000 orders, and in October 2023, with revenue at $230.12K from 40,300 orders. Subsequent months saw a slight recovery in revenue and order numbers, largely due to sustained order volume growth.
- Despite a general downward trend, Gross Profit for the full year 2023 remained positive. This was largely attributed to a strong performance in April, where revenue and order volume surpassed April 2022 figures by 15% and 25%, respectively.
- Year-on-year order value increased in February 2024, driven by a 35.56% rise in the market share of outdoor orders in China.
